# Getting MEAN book project

This is the project described in the book Getting MEAN by Simon Holmes

## Chapter 3

Don't forget to include the link to the [Heroku app](https://warm-plateau-96144.herokuapp.com/)!

Notes
* Installations from appendix A & Appendix B are necessary to get Ch 3 code working.
* The `foreman start` command (p. 75) is obsolete. Run `heroku local` instead.

The app so far should look like this on Heroku:
