# Getting MEAN 2nd Edition book project

This is the project described in the book Getting MEAN (2nd Ed) by Simon Holmes. Your Readme.md should look something approximately like this one.

For each chapter, add a note with the following:
* A description in your own words (>= 80 words) of the functionality you implemented and how it works, and list any challenges or problems you encountered.
* The answer to all **readme questions** listed on this page for the chapter. 
* A screenshot of the current state of your work (see my chapter notes on this page for each chapter for specifics on what you should include in the screenshot).

Add your chapter notes **in descending order, with the latest on top,** as I've done below. Scroll to the bottom of this readme to see some tips on how to use the Markdown notation to get the elements you need.

**Submit the link to Moodle** by the appropriate assignment deadline. 

### Committing and tagging

While working through the book, you should be doing **regular Git commits** (at least 4 per chapter) so I can view the specifics of your progress. This is done like this:

```
git add .
git commit -m "your comment here"
```

Always include a brief but *meaningful* comment. Do not make comments like "blahblah" or "some stuff". [Here's some good advice on commit messages](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

In addition, as you complete each chapter, you should **commit and tag** the release representing that chapter, so I can quickly go to the last commit for each chapter. Look at the commit history of this repository to see an example. [Here's the documentation on tagging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging). You must also push your commits to GitHub and Heroku. Pushing to GitHub (with tags) should look something like this:

```
git push origin master --tags
```

**Always ensure that your code is working before committing it.** You should be manually testing your work **frequently** so that you don't write too much code to quickly debug it if it's not working properly.

This Readme has been modified throughout the process of implementing the project, so please always refer to the latest version of the Readme, rather than tagged chapter releases.

Don't forget to include the link to the [Heroku app](https://getting-mean-book-tm.herokuapp.com/)!

Notes
* Installations from appendix A & Appendix B are necessary to get Ch 3 code working.
* Any reference to any file with the extension `.jade` should be changed to `.pug`.
* Jade/Pug files are indentation based. Wrong indentation in these files will throw your layout out of wack. Turn on Show Indent Guide and Show Invisibles in Atom (Preferences > Editor) to see the spaces in your editor. Also, refer to the author's GitHub code directly to check the indentation when the indentation is borked in the book or e-book (as I write this, Listing 3.7 in the epub version is extremely borked).
  

The app so far should look like this on Heroku (include a screenshot with each chapter's update!):

**Ch 3 Readme Questions**

1. The default `app.js` file generated by Express declares variables using the `var` keyword. What are the two new keywords introduced in EcmaScript 6 that the author discusses, and what is his recommendation for declaring variables in `app.js`?
2. What do we call the process of mapping URL requests to the functionality we want to associate with the URL? For example, when the URL `/` is requested (this represents the base URL for our application's domain), we want to execute the controller function that renders our title page. What do we call the code that connects a URL request to our controller code?

### Markdown

This Readme file was written in the (GitHub Flavored) [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) (`.md`) language. Look at this Readme in "raw" view to see [the markup code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UPS-CSCI240-F16/GM/master/Readme.md).
